As I read more, I further understood that cybersecurity is indeed paramount in today's context due to increasing digitalised processes. This prompted me to take online courses in programming and markup languages such as HTML, JavaScript, and Python. I also went for a four days cybersecurity workshop organised by NYP. It was enriching and exposed me to different skills used in cybersecurity. As part of the class committee, I brought my classmates together to decorate the netball court for our school carnival, preparing me to be class chairperson this year. I was also given the National Youth Achievement Award - Bronze Medal. My interest in science has been cultivated from a young age, which is why I participated in the Big Science Competition for three years. This consists of an interdisciplinary MCQ paper, and by reading up on related areas, I managed to earn Distinction twice. One event that allows me to combine my skills in this area is the Science and Technology Competition in NYP. We were tasked with designing a catapult that would shoot ping pong balls through a particular target. As the leader of my team, I delegated the tasks to my members so that we could make the best-designed machine under the constraints of time and resources given. Outside of academics, I am an active sportsman, participating in inter-school competitions such as South Zone Nationals and T-Net.",1

During two visits to NYP, I explored both SIT and SIDM. After lecturers discussed with me, I was hooked into cybersecurity and found the idea of an ethical hacker interesting. I want to be part of the advancing digital world's defence and I believe NYP will aid me. Being in NPCC in secondary school offered me the opportunities to learn and grow as a person. Being in a UG, I have to show good characteristics and work ethic. Working well with others and being more responsible are some of the things I had to learn while being in NPCC. Active participation in various events held by the HQ or teachers were also important. I also took part in competitions with other NPCC units, namely the camp craft and drills competition. Even though leadership may be something I lack in, I work well with others and am able to meet my responsibilities. This, along with active participation in events has helped me to attain the Staff Seargent rank in NPCC.

Before that,I studied in China. In China, there is a huge amount of stress from studying. This is due to limited resources and opportunities, hence the level of competition is high. Thus, I am used to dealing with stress and finding ways to increase my efficiency in work. In addition, I have attended the national examination for foreigners to get the opportunity to study in Singapore. I studied at the national language school to learn English. For me, English is an almost brand-new language for me. This changed the way I speak and the way I used to write in Chinese. Therefore, I believe that I have the ability to learn new knowledge even though I had never tried it yet. I was in my CCA committee group which is MEDIATCH. I was the trainer and I had the responsibility to teach every member in this CCA to understand what this CCA is about and how to complete their duties correctly.",0

I was lucky to be one of the 20 students out of 100 applicants who aced the flight simulator exercise and interview to get into SYFC. As part of the SYFC, I have taken part in intra-SYFC competitions like glider building, flight simulations and Pylon racing. I have also taken part in Gliderfest@RP in Sec 1 as part of the Hillgrove team. I have also spent hours in flight simulator X which has honed my skills in flight simulation. This year, I mentored a Sec 1 student in what they would do in SYFC during the year. I have been to SP a few times during the last four years for CCA related activities.
